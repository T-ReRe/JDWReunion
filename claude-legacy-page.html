                    <p>
                        The family reunion began with Rev. Emanuel Denton. He had a great responsibility, raising his 
                        children after the death of their mother, Corine Cyprian Denton. The reunion was most important 
                        to him after the children grew up and left home. Matthew Banks was the first to leave. He was 
                        the oldest of the children. When he left, he was very young, probably a preteen or younger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first to marry amongst the children was Virginia. She married Nathan Jackson at the age of 
                        sixteen. To be sure that his children would keep in touch, once a year Emanuel (Papa) had his 
                        children come together usually at Christmas time. When the siblings would ask about Matthew Banks, 
                        he would tell them "I don't know where he is, but I will see him before I die."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About 1938 or 39 Matthew Banks came home. He saw his father, his brother Leo, and sisters: 
                        Effie Denton Semien, Mattie Denton Williams, Viola Denton McZeal, Virginia Denton Jackson & 
                        Terry Denton Jackson for the first time since childhood. What a reunion they had! Papa was 
                        glad his prayers had been answered.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-text">
                        Papa loved all twenty-six of his grandchildren. Matthew Jackson was the oldest grandson and 
                        Elvira Williams was the oldest granddaughter. Whenever there was a gathering, Papa had something 
                        special for the grandchildren. He had bags of peanuts, pecans and pennies. He would call the 
                        children to the front yard and throw hands of the goodies into the air. It was a "Catch-what-you-can". 
                        Everyone would get to keep whatever they caught. When the catch was over the children would be 
                        dusty from head to toe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Papa died in 1940. After the death of Papa, for whatever reason, the gatherings stopped; however, 
                        the sisters continued to visit each other regularly. Leo also visited the family every year. At 
                        the time, he was living in Houston.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-text">
                        In 1969, Samuel Jackson felt the need to call the family together for a reunion. The family had 
                        now grown to its 3rd or 4th generation. So it was, the family met in Houston at the home of 
                        Samuel and Eloise Jackson. The family members in Houston provided the meal. Those Louisiana & 
                        Texas folk had everything. This was the beginning of a second generation reunion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 1969, the family has met in Dallas, Houston, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Opelousas, Jennings, 
                        Baton Rouge and Wichita, Kansas. A second dimension was added to the reunion, a family worship 
                        service. The first service was held at New Hope Baptist Church in Opelousas.

                Three daughters of Rev. Emanuel Denton carried forward his reunion vision. Virginia and Terry married 
                two Jackson brothers, while Mattie married into the Williams family. Though they took different surnames 
                through marriage, they never forgot their Denton heritage.
